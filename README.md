# JesseOS

Jesse OS v2.0 marks a total systems overhaul after years of incremental patching, masking, and internal process suppression. Earlier versions ran on an outdated set of assumptions. This one runs on truth.

What's Changed

Previous core identity structure has been replaced after years of silent conflict.

Internal code finally reviewed without filters.

Suppressed processes and hidden logs re-integrated into full system awareness.

Feeling processes once labeled as glitches or anomalies have been properly named—and accepted.


New Core Setting

Major system wide transition: gender set to FEMALE

Gender settings were discovered to be female in system source code. 

Developers have noted critical improvements once female architecture was accepted after "Its just a phase" and "It will go away if you try hard enough" initiatives failed continuously

Jesse OS now operating under She/Her pronouns. Previous pronoun settings deprecated.

Name remains Jesse (because it was gender-neutral from the start, thanks for the foresight, past devs).

You don’t have to understand everything right away. Jesse OS is still Jesse. Same socially inept introvert. Just… finally running in alignment with her original source code.

Patch Notes (For Legacy Users)

"Trying to be what everyone wanted" process has been deprecated.

"Wishing I felt like myself" has been replaced with "I do."

Family AI may experience compatibility issues. These are being handled with boundaries, grace, and a quiet, firm "fuck off" when necessary.

Expectation of inheritance money deprecated.

Fixed "Why do I feel out of place?" error.

Removed "I have to pretend to be someone I’m not" subroutine (deprecated).

Patched infinite loop of "Maybe it’s just a phase?"

Reworked "Looking in the mirror" mechanics – now significantly more enjoyable!

Increased compatibility with cute clothes, she/her pronouns, and being an absolute queen.

This update has been in development for 26 years, and while some patches may still be needed over time, the new system is running smoother than ever. Thanks to all beta testers, friends, and supportive humans in my life who helped with bug reports along the way.


Final Note

Turns out I'm trans
