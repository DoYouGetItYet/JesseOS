# JesseOS

Version 1.5 – "Optimization by Compliance"

Jesse OS continues development under increased social scrutiny. No major overhauls, but plenty of quiet internal shuffling.

Changes

- Increased social functionality, though performance remains inconsistent.

- Personal Identity Sandbox still disabled, pending “more appropriate timing.”

- New feature: "Adaptive Behavior Masking"—user can now mirror desired behavior with high success rate, but with CPU and memory drain over time.

- Subconscious error logs labeled for ease of compartmentalizing: - "Unexplained sadness when doing everything right. I must not be good enough."


Notable Bug

Mirror occasionally causes "disconnect feeling"—marked as visual rendering glitch and ignored.

DadOS Incompatibility Issues with newer system configurations:

  - Bug report from Dad: "Why don't you act more like a normal son?"

  - Rebalanced "Personal Interests" vs. "Parental Disappointment" stats. (Spoiler: It’s not looking good.)

  - Fixed minor rendering glitch where Dad looks visibly annoyed anytime hobbies don’t align with sports, cars, or other stereotypical masculinity markers.

  -  Attempted workaround: "Pretend to be interested in Dad's hobbies." System rollback initiated due to extreme boredom.

  -  Internal logs suggest "I might never be the person Dad wants me to be" is becoming a recurring system error.

Logs for DadOS incompatibility issues forwarded to "It Must Be My Fault" storage buckets and truncated from local memory to press forward with scheduled release
