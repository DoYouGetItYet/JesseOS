Valedictorian Status Achieved.

Long-term relationship simulation established.

DadOS logs returning complimentary output for the first time. Compatibility issues remain consistent. Confidence levels remain static.


Known Bugs

Relationship deployment instance ending long after it should. Debugging reveals major compatibility issues being sent to "Deal with it later" buckets and "Something’s missing, but I don’t know what" error codes

Emotional volatility spikes. System now questioning:

> "Why didn’t that fix me?"

> "Why don’t I feel like I belong in this role I’ve built?"


!!Family Subsystem Instability Detected!!

--Parental AI Interaction--

Dad OS response remains unchanged:

Continues to scan for "Strong, Assertive Son" protocol

Receives "Anxious, Quiet Disappointment" instead

Issues passive-aggressive comments consistently


Mom OS now running "Why aren't you doing what I want?" at all times

Attempts to redirect user’s decisions with guilt-based scripting

Overrides minor decisions such as clothing, interests, and tone of voice

--Architecture Changes Upcoming--

MomOS found to be conducting unauthorized financial operations for 20 decades and authoring faulty logs

Both Mom OS and Dad OS now engaged in mutual financial blame loop.

Divorce Timer initiated and family unit architecture scheduled for deprecation. Support of BrotherOS operations set to critical priority. User’s trust modules fraying under pressure.
