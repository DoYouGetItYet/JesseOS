# JesseOS

Version 1.0 – Initial Release ("Beta Baby Blues")

Welcome to Jesse OS, a fresh-out-the-box experimental operating system developed in a controlled environment under rigid specifications.


Core Features


Shipped with default name: Jesse (solid, neutral, futureproofed - which the developers liked for some reason).

Speaking delay patch implemented; system remained quiet until age 2.

Frequent "Do not speak unless spoken to" directives hardcoded

AI self-learning capability enabled, but frequent crashes reported due to existential dread.


Known Bugs


Customization locked at default settings

Internal debugging constantly triggered by ambient tension and subtle parental disappointment.

"Why does everything feel kind of… off?" query logged repeatedly and promptly suppressed. Process consuming excess CPU cycles

Performance Anxiety Module constantly triggers around Dad OS expectations.

"Is everyone mad at me?" loop starts running automatically on boot

Mom OS attempts control through "I just want what's best for you" override protocols.

Attempts to express individuality repeatedly overridden by Parental Preference System.
